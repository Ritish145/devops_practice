# DevOps Practice Repository
This repository contains my **daily DevOps practice scripts and exercises**.  
I am following a structured roadmap (Linux → Git → AWS → Docker → CI/CD → Monitoring) to build a strong foundation and become job-ready as a DevOps Engineer.

## 📅 Week 1 – Linux & Git Basics

**Day 1:** [day1.sh](week1/day1/day1.sh)  
- Prints today’s date and the current directory.  
- Covers: basic bash scripting, file execution with `chmod +x`.  

**Day 2:** [day2.sh](week1/day2/day2.sh)  
- Shows user info with `whoami`, `id`, and `groups`  
- Demonstrates file permissions (`ls -l`)  
- Changes permissions with `chmod` (644 and +x examples)  
- Includes placeholder for adding a demo user (commented out for safety)   

**Day 3:** (coming soon)  
- Focus: Processes & Monitoring.  

... and so on.

## 🎯 Goal
By the end of this roadmap, this repo will showcase:  
- 6+ weeks of daily DevOps practice  
- Scripts, configs, and mini-projects  
- A portfolio to demonstrate **hands-on DevOps skills**
