# DevOps Practice Repository
This repository contains my **daily DevOps practice scripts and exercises**.  
I am following a structured roadmap (Linux → Git → AWS → Docker → CI/CD → Monitoring) to build a strong foundation and become job-ready as a DevOps Engineer.

## 📅 Week 1 – Linux & Git Basics

**Day 1:** [day1.sh](week1/day1/day1.sh)  
- Prints today’s date and the current directory.  
- Covers: basic bash scripting, file execution with `chmod +x`.  

**Day 2:** (coming soon)  
- Focus: Users & Permissions.  

**Day 3:** (coming soon)  
- Focus: Processes & Monitoring.  

... and so on.

## 🎯 Goal
By the end of this roadmap, this repo will showcase:  
- 6+ weeks of daily DevOps practice
